Credit-Based Document Scanning System

Overview:

The Credit-Based Document Scanning System is a self-contained application that allows users to upload and scan documents for similarity detection. Each user receives 20 free scans per day, with the option to request additional credits from an admin. The system also includes an analytics dashboard for tracking scans and credit usage.

Features:

1. User Authentication & Role Management

User Registration & Login (Username & Password-based authentication)

User Roles: Regular Users & Admins

Profile Section: Displays available credits, scan history, and credit requests
